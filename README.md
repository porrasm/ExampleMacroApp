# ExampleMacroApp
An already setup test application using https://github.com/porrasm/macro-framework

## Setup

Clone this repo, install dependencies via Nuget and run. I recommend Visual Studio for this project over VSCode.

In addition to the MacroFramework, another Nuget package is added as a dependency: https://www.nuget.org/packages/WinUtilities/
This library offers great Windows automation tools for C#.
